## Introduction
"Video Game Information" is an application that gives the user information about all the video game information that has been entered by a user. The program will allow the user to input the name, total hours played, price, and personal game rating from 1-5 stars for 5 video games. The user will then receive a result of average game hours, total money spent, average game ratings, and some feedback. My intended user is one who wants to know about how much they have played and spent on 5 video games, and they will also want to know how much they enjoy or dislike the 5 video games as whole or average.
