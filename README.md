# COP 3014CE Project (Video Game Information)
In this project, I will create a program that gives video game information using C++. The program will allow the user to input the name, total hours played, price, and personal game rating from 1-5 stars for 5 video games. The user will then receive a result of average game hours, total money spent, average game ratings, and some feedback.
