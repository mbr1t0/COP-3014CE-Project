## Statement of Independent Effort

_Only keep the statement that applies_

I, ***[YOUR NAME]***, hereby certify that is my original work completed without the assistance of anyone or
any outside resources.

**OR**

I, ***[YOUR NAME]***, hereby certify that this is my original work completed with the assistance of ***[NAME]***/the resources listed in the reference. I used these resources in the following areas: ***[...]***.


## Analysis of Specifications

_Analysis of specifications is where you identify the inputs, outputs, and processes performed by the code. An example process in a blackjack game would be "generate a random card for the user". This section must contain an IPO chart for each function._

### Main

_Fill in the values in the IPO Chart. See video in Canvas for example._

| Input    | Process  | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Text     | Text     | Text     |


## Pseudocode

_Paste pseudocode here_

```text=
BEGIN Main
    DECLARE String name
END
```

## Flowchart

_Paste flowchart image here. Note that the image has to uploaded to your repository and then a link added here_

[//]: <> (The syntax to add an image can be found here - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1)

## Test Cases

_Test cases should include edge cases (values near the upper and lower bounds of the allowed values), and acceptable and unacceptable values. Produce at least 5 unique cases._

**Example (remove from submission)**

|Case #|Case Description|Input|Condition (price > creditLimit)|Output|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|1|Item that should be approved|Price = 7800|False |Approved|
|2|Item that should be approved (edge case)|Price = 8000 |False|Approved|
|3|Item that should not be approved|Price = 10000|True| Not Approved|


## Code

_Include a link to your `cpp` file._

## User Manual
_Include a link to a separate file called GUIDE.md_
