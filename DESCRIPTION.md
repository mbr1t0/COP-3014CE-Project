## Project Description:

**Title: Video Game Information**

**Description:**
In this project, I will create a program that gives video game information using C++. The program will allow the user to input the name, total hours played, price, and personal game rating from 1-5 stars for 5 video games. The user will then receive a result of average game hours, total money spent, average game ratings, and some feedback.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Implement a user-friendly input system to capture game information. Prompt the user for details such as the name of the game, total hours played on the game, price of the game, and personal game rating.
   - Use appropriate data types (string and integer) to store different aspects of the game information.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Create a file to store the game information data persistently. Each entry should be stored with details like the name of the game, total hours played on the game, price of the game, and personal game rating.
   - Utilize file input/output operations (ifstream and ofstream) to read from and write to the file.

3. **Average Rate Feedback Categorization:**
   - Implement if/else statements to categorize feedback for average rate based on user-defined criteria. For example, categorize the average rate feedback as "Wow!," "Not Bad!," and "Ouch!"

4. **Results:**
   - Develop a function to generate the results that displays the total average hours played, total money spent, and average game ratings. Ensure proper formatting for readability.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement a user menu that allows users to input game information, view the results, and exit the program.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include if/else statements to handle potential errors, such as invalid user input or file reading errors.
